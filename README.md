# Agent Actions

Agent Actions is a Python SDK and CLI for AI agent lifecycle hooks. You write
guardrails and checks as Python classes. The framework runs them on the hooks of
Claude Code, VS Code (GitHub Copilot agent) and GitHub Copilot CLI, keeps their
state between calls, and records each call under `.hooks/`.

- One runner file works in all supported harnesses.
- A process on a hook that cannot deliver its result fails loudly, not silently.
- Each process can declare state. The framework restores and records it.
- Included processes: path guards, shell guard, required tests and commands,
  loop guard, post-edit check, context injection, tool call budget.
- No runtime dependencies. Python 3.11 or later.

## Quick start

1. Install the package in the virtual environment of your project:

   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/fleskovar/agent_actions
   ```

2. Create a runner file, for example `agent_checks.py`:

   ```python
   import agent_actions as aa
   from agent_actions.processes import BlockReads, BlockWrites, LoopGuard, RequireTests

   context = aa.get_current_context()
   context.add(BlockWrites(["tests/**"]))
   context.add(BlockReads([".env", "secrets/**"]))
   context.add(LoopGuard(RequireTests(), max_blocks=3))
   aa.run(context)
   ```

3. Install the hooks for your harness:

   ```bash
   agent_actions install agent_checks.py --target claude
   ```

   The command writes `.claude/settings.json`. The hook commands use the
   absolute path of the Python interpreter of the virtual environment.

4. Start the agent. When it tries to edit `tests/test_x.py`, the edit is denied
   with a reason. When it tries to stop while tests fail, it continues, at most
   three times.

The [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) explains each step and shows how to write your
own process.

## Supported harnesses

| Target | Configuration file | Hooks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `.claude/settings.json` | all 9 neutral hooks |
| `vscode` | `.github/hooks/agent-actions-vscode.json` | all except `session-end` |
| `copilot-cli` | `.github/hooks/agent-actions-copilot-cli.json` | all except `subagent-start` and `pre-compact` |

[docs/data-model.md](docs/data-model.md) lists the verdicts and context channels
per harness and hook.

## Write a process

```python
import agent_actions as aa


class NoTodoInFinalAnswer(aa.StopProcess):
    """Keeps the agent working while its last message mentions TODO, at most twice."""

    def __init__(self, max_reminders: int = 2) -> None:
        self.max_reminders = max_reminders

    def __state__(self) -> None:
        self.reminders = 0

    def run(self, event: aa.HookInput) -> aa.ProcessResult:
        if "TODO" in (event.last_message or "") and self.reminders < self.max_reminders:
            self.reminders += 1
            aa.log(f"reminder {self.reminders}")
            return aa.block("Your answer mentions TODO. Finish the open items first.")
        return aa.allow()
```

- Extend the family class of the hook: `PreToolProcess`, `PostToolProcess`,
  `PromptProcess`, `StopProcess`, `StartProcess` or `EventProcess`.
- Set state attributes in `__state__`. Do not set them in `__init__`.
- Give a reason with each `block` or `ask`. The agent reads it.

## Session files

```text
.hooks/
    20260915T100000000_3f1c9a2e/        <UTC timestamp>_<short session id>
        session.json
        main-agent/
            state.json                   state, inputs and outputs per step and process
            io.json                      raw stdin, stdout and exit code per step
            log.txt                      agent_actions.log() lines
        Explore_20260915T100512345/      one folder per subagent
```

Replay a recorded call with `agent_actions run agent_checks.py --harness claude
--hook pre-tool --input payload.json`.

## CLI

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent_actions run RUNNER --harness H --hook K [--input FILE]` | Run one hook call. The harness calls this. |
| `agent_actions install RUNNER [--target H] [--timeout S]` | Write the hook configuration. Asks for the harness when `--target` is missing. |
| `agent_actions sessions` | List recorded sessions, newest first. |
| `agent_actions skills [--dest DIR]` | Copy the agent skill for authoring processes (default `.claude/skills`). |

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate            # Windows; use .venv/bin/activate on Linux and macOS
pip install -e .[dev]

make test                         # lint, type check and all tests: what CI runs
make test-unit                    # the fast loop
make test-cases                   # the human-readable hook cases
make test-case CASE=claude-edit-of-protected-test-is-denied
make debug-case CASE=claude-edit-of-protected-test-is-denied
make debug-test K=test_most_restrictive_verdict_wins
```

Each folder in `tests/cases/` is one behaviour: `inputs/`, `outputs/` and a
`README.md` walkthrough. The [case index](tests/cases/README.md) lists all of
them and what each one pins. To add a case, add a folder. In VS Code, the launch
configuration "Debug one hook case" runs one case under the debugger.

The development plan and its progress are on the light-plan board in `.lpm/`
(`lpm ui`).
