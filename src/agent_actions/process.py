"""Process base classes. A process runs on hooks and returns a ProcessResult.

A process family fixes the hooks that a process can attach to and the verdicts
that it can return. `Context.add` checks both against the harness, so a process
on the wrong hook fails at install time instead of failing silently in the agent.

State: the attributes that `__state__` creates are the state variables. The
framework restores their last recorded values before `run` and records them after.
